# DeepLearning
See the worked code at Deep_Learning_Recommender_Worked.ipynb or run it using google collab with this link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13b_RCswr4jm7KuTVzBCtt8b5xtOgBNxK?usp=sharing 

Dataset that used :
1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data 
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

note : some plots maybe can't displayed properly when running the code, so all the plot need to save into html format, and then showing it with other function. All the graph and plot can be viewed in "Deep_Learning_Recommender_Worked" folder
